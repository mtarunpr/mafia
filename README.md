# Mafia

Runs the role-playing game Mafia and eliminates the need for a human moderator. Currently only supports exactly 9 players, and also requires the use of a console where Ctrl-L clears the screen.

Compile the code by running

    javac src\mafia\Mafia.java src\mafia\Player.java

and run the game by first navigating into the src folder

    cd src

and then executing

    java mafia.Mafia
